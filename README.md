[Terrive](https://terrive.on.fleek.co) is a decetralized social media platform that supports images, albums and videos. The UI/UX was made using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) 5. It uses the [Hive](https://hive.io) Blockchain as an immutable database while leaving the image & video hosting to be independently hosted by the user or upload them to [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) using the integrated uploader. The website is also hosted on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io) by [Fleek](https://fleek.co)
